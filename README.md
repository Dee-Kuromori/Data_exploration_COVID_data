# Data_exploration_COVID_data

The purpose of this project is to explore global Covid-19 data from 2020. This project focuses on the the data from a perspective of vaccines and deaths. 
To do this, I broke apart a larger covid csv file into two seperate files for deaths and vaccines with their related columns, and then I used python and 
its csv module to limit file size to only keep data from 2020. I had to do this because, the original file was too large and would take a very long time 
to process in SQL Server. After uploading csv files into SQL Server, I explored the data from different aspects. I also explored data once in python using 
pandas package to see how it would be possible in python.
